One of my favorite foods is pasta. I like pasta because it can be served in diverse ways. I like 
pasta with pesto. I also like pasta with alfredo sauce. There are over 600 pasta shapes. 
Pasta can also be served in many ways. For example, it can be served with vegetables or no
vegetables. It can also be served with eggplant. There are also many different sauces that pasta
can be enjoyed with. Some fun facts about pasta is that an average Italian eats 60 pounds of pasta per year. 
Also, a typical portion of pasta is only 100 grams. You can find more facts on
